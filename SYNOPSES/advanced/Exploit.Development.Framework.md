# Custom Exploit Development Framework

## Overview
Build a modular exploitation framework where each vulnerability is implemented as a plugin, supporting payload generation, shellcode encoding, and target validation. This project teaches exploit development, payload crafting, and demonstrates core functionality of frameworks like Metasploit used in penetration testing and security research.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Understand exploit development methodology and framework architecture** by learning that exploits follow general pattern: reconnaissance (target identification and vulnerability confirmation), exploit delivery (trigger vulnerability), payload execution (execute attacker code), and post-exploitation (maintain access, exfiltrate data). Study framework architecture: modular design with separate exploit plugins, payload generators, encoder chains, and delivery mechanisms enables code reuse and rapid exploitation development. Research existing frameworks (Metasploit, Exploit Pack, Canvas) understanding their architecture and capabilities.

2. **Implement core framework architecture** with plugin system: create base exploit class defining interface all exploits must implement (check method validating target is vulnerable, exploit method executing actual attack). Implement plugin loader discovering exploit files and instantiating exploit objects. Build configuration management: command-line interface or configuration file specifying target, payload, encoding, and other options. Create logging and output systems tracking exploitation attempts and results.

3. **Build payload generation system** that supports multiple payload types: create command execution payloads (shell commands executed on target), reverse shell payloads (connect back to attacker), bind shell payloads (listen on target accepting incoming connections), meterpreter payloads (advanced multi-function agents), and staged payloads (small initial payload downloads full payload). Implement payload architecture supporting different languages/platforms: Windows executables, Linux ELF binaries, PowerShell scripts, JavaScript, etc.

4. **Create shellcode encoder chains** that transform raw shellcode into deliverable format: implement encoders avoiding bad characters (null bytes prevent string-based overflow payloads, specific characters might be filtered), implementing encryption (encode shellcode then execute decoder on target), and obfuscation (evade antivirus/IDS detection). Build encoder combinations: chain multiple encoders for defense-in-depth encoding. Support polymorphic encoding: each encoded output differs even with same input, evading signature-based detection.

5. **Implement target validation and scanning** determining whether exploitation is applicable: build probe functions checking target vulnerability (does service run vulnerable version), build fingerprinting identifying target characteristics (OS, installed software, network configuration). Support automated scanning discovering vulnerable targets in networks, allowing batch exploitation. Implement safeguards preventing exploitation of unintended targets (verification prompts, IP range validation).

6. **Build exploit plugin library** starting with common vulnerabilities: implement exploits for well-known CVEs (Heartbleed, EternalBlue, WannaCry-related, etc.), support common vulnerability types (buffer overflows, SQL injection, command injection). Each exploit plugin contains: vulnerability description, affected versions, exploitation logic, and recommended payloads. Create documentation templates for exploit development enabling security researchers to add new exploits.

7. **Implement post-exploitation capabilities** enabling actions after gaining access: build command execution modules (execute arbitrary commands on compromised system), file transfer modules (upload/download files), system enumeration (gather system information), credential harvesting (dump passwords from memory), and persistence mechanisms (establish backdoors). Create chaining allowing multi-stage attacks (initial exploit → pivot to other systems → exfiltrate data).

8. **Build comprehensive documentation with usage examples** explaining exploit development methodology, payload generation techniques, and encoder usage. Provide ethical guidelines emphasizing this is for authorized testing only, include legal warnings about unauthorized computer access. Create tutorials for developing new exploit plugins, provide examples of exploitation workflows (reconnaissance → scanning → target selection → exploitation), and include incident response considerations. Compare your framework to Metasploit discussing architectural decisions, limitations (smaller scope but potentially more customizable), and intended use cases (focused security research vs. general penetration testing framework).
